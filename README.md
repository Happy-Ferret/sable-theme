Visual Studio Code Dark Theme
===
Based on ``Dark+`` (the default VS Code Dark Theme), ``Sable`` 
seeks to improve the legibility of code through
enhanced color coding while simultaneously minimizing eye-strain.

While the current development focus is on improving Go syntax highlighting,
I will gladly accept PRs for any other language.

**Note:** For visibility in the theme selection popup, the theme
was given the label ``Happy Ferret's Sable (Dark)`` rather than ``Sable (Dark)``. See also [this 2019 GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4UFC0y1tY0).

**Enjoy!**
